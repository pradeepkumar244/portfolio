<p>If you peer over a longtime UNIX userâ€™s shoulder while he or she works, you might be mesmerized by the strange chant being murmured at the command line, isnâ€™t it !. One thing is sure , the more you work with UNIX, the more likely you are to create scripts. A script saves the time and energy required to retype complex and long sequences of commands, preventing mistakes, too. I have also prepared a bunch of scripts to simplify my day to day job.</p>
