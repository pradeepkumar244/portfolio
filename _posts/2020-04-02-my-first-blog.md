My favourite are
```
- Emotions are what make us human. Make us real. The word 'emotion' stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.

- Once a dollar goes into your asset column. It becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations.

- Difference between assets and liabilities.

- We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence.

- Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they're not afraid of losing.

- If you have any desire to be rich, you must focus. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets and focus. Follow One Course Until Successful.
