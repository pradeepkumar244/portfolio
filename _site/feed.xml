My favourite are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Emotions are what make us human. Make us real. The word 'emotion' stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not against yourself.

- Once a dollar goes into your asset column. It becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations.

- Difference between assets and liabilities.

- We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence.

- Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they're not afraid of losing.

- If you have any desire to be rich, you must focus. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets and focus. Follow One Course Until Successful.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;If you peer over a longtime UNIX user’s shoulder while he or she works, you might be mesmerized by the strange chant being murmured at the command line, isn’t it !. One thing is sure , the more you work with UNIX, the more likely you are to create scripts. A script saves the time and energy required to retype complex and long sequences of commands, preventing mistakes, too. I have also prepared a bunch of scripts to simplify my day to day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Alerting when my filesystem usage surpasses a defined limit.
- Counting particular directories on a virtual server. It’s great for preventing diskusage problems.
- Checking the expiration date of the certs being used on the server.
- Monitoring my log files on the server , they can be troublesome , if they are not cleaned periodically.
- Extract any archive ( grepping the extension and running case statement a/q )
- Preventing my Mac to sleep while downloading chuck of data ( used caffeinate ).
- Force stop and clean Docker containers.
- Deleting screenshots from my desktop.
- Checking the file with 777 permission , they can be dangerous though.
- I use cron to schedule these tasks to run on a periodic basis and sends the results to me on the mail .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s your favourite script ;)
I hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
